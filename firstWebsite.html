<h1 style="font-size:80px;"> Chapitre 1: The Derivative </h1>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p> The derivative can be explained as the slope at any point on the graph</p>
    <p> For instance, imagine you were given the graph of 2x<sup>2</sup>. How would you go about finding the slope at, lets say, 3?</p>
    <p> An easier method is to use the following rule to determine derivatives</p>
    <p> A useful link is provided to graph functions to see their behavior</p>
    <a href="https://www.desmos.com/"><i><b> Desmos Graphing Utility </b></i></a>
    <br>
    <p> <i><b>First Technique</b></i>: nx<sup>n-1</sup></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Example #1</b> Using the above technique, find the slope of 3x<sup>3</sup> at x = 4.</p>
    <p>The first step here is to find the derivative. Using the method, we  achieve the expression</p>
    <p><b>3(3)x<sup>3-1</sup></b>, which gets us the value f'(x) = <b></b>9x<sup>2</sup></b>.</p>
    <p> Now, since we are asked to find the value at x = 4, we are to plug in this value of 4 into the value of f'(x)</p>
    <p>f'(4) = 9(4)<sup>2</sup> = <b>144</b>.</p>
    <p> Here is a simple derivative to find. </p>
    <p> e<sup> x </sup></p>
    <p> However, interestingly enough, the derivative is still e<sup> x</sup>!</p>
    <p> These are common derivatives that you should know to be successful in AP Calculus AB / BC.  </p>
    <b>ln(x) d/dx = 1/x </b>
    <p><b> e<sup> x </sup> d/dx = e<sup> x </sup></b><p>
    <b> 1/x d/dx = 1/x<sup>2</sup></b>`
    <p><b> sinx d/dx = cosx </b></p>
    <p><b> cosx d/dx = -sin x </b></p>
    <b> tanx d/dx = sec<sup>2</sup>x</b> 
    <p><b> secx d/dx = secxtanx </b></p>
    <p><b> cscx d/dx = -cscxcotx</b></p>
    <b> cotx d/dx = -csc<sup>2</sup>x</b>
    <p> Another variety of derivatives persist with the <b>Chain rule</b> and the <b>Quotient Rule</b>.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:80px;"> Chapitre 2: The Integral </h1>
<section>
        <P> Now, as we dive deeper, we soon reach <i>integrals</i>.</P>
        <p> Integrals, otherwise known as the area, are relatively easy to calculate.</p>
        <p> Here is an image to better represent the area. </p>
        

        <p> Here is an integral listed below: </p>
        <p> <em>&#x222b</em>2x dx </p>

        <p> In order to solve this, we will need to look at a simple rule: </p>

        <p><i><b>Second Technique:</b></i> x<sup>n+1</sup>/(n+1)</p>

        <p> Now look back at the question <em>&#x222b</em>2x dx. Take out the 2 away from the integral, so that it is now 2<em>&#x222b</em>x dx. </p>

        <p> Now we have 2 <em>&#x222b</em>x dx. Using our knowledge from the rule above, we get x<sup> 1+1</sup> /(1+1).</p>

        <p> Finally, we get the 2x<sup>2</sup>/2 as our final value. This can be further simplified to achieve an answer of</p>

    <p> <b>x<sup>2</sup></b> </p>

    <h><b> Some common integration techniques are as listed below:</b></h>
        <p></p><li><b> U - Substitution</b></li></p>
        <p><li><b> Integration by Parts</b></li></p>
        <p><li><b> Trig- Substitution </b></li></p>
        
    <p><li><b> Long division (Algebra 2 Content)</b></li></p>
    <p> Even though not used as frequently, it is a topic that is a must - know for all calculus students.</p>
